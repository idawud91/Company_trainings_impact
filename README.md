Are company trainings worthwhile? A look at their impact on training and engagement.
I'm sure we can all relate to exceptional dullness of those old school workplace trainings, typically required on the first day of a new job. They're usually related to policy, look like they were filmed in the 1980s and tend to aggressively apply awful alliteration. Now, don't get me wrong, I love a bit of nostalgia, but do they really do anything? Surely, corporate trainings must have some benefit, especially if they're job relevant and not just busy-work on your first day, right?

Well, let's make a quick distinction: I'm sure you could put a solid ROI on the compliance trainings, these limit liabilitis and probably save most companies quite a bit in the long-term. But what about trainings geared towards employee development and growth?

In theory, these trainings should result in new skills, awareness of current trends in a given field, increased expsoure to the business for employees outside of operations and even networking/collaboration opportunities. In terms of measureable impacts, these trainings should positively impact an individual's performance (again, theoretically). If nothing else, they should give employees a sense of growth and positively impact engagement. I'm going to test this to see what impact, if any, a company training has on these two metrics.
